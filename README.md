# Decoder Toolki

Welcome to Decoder-Toolkit, your comprehensive collection of decoders used in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. This repository houses a variety of decoding tools and scripts that can assist you in solving various challenges encountered in CTFs.

## Overview

In the world of cybersecurity and CTFs, decoding messages, ciphertexts, and encoded data is often a crucial step in solving challenges. Whether it's deciphering encrypted text, decoding base64 strings, or unraveling complex encoding schemes, having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference.

This toolkit aims to provide you with a diverse set of decoders, each tailored to handle different types of encoding and encryption methods commonly encountered in CTF challenges. Whether you're a beginner looking to expand your knowledge or a seasoned CTF veteran seeking efficient decoding solutions, you'll find something useful here.

## Contents

This repository contains decoders for various encoding and encryption techniques, including but not limited to:

- Hex
- Base16
- Base64
- Base32
- ASCII85
- URL encoding
- Morse code
- Caesar cipher
- Vigen√®re cipher
- XOR encryption
- ROT13
- Brainfuck
- HTML Entity
- Punnycode
- Quoted Printale
- Unicode
- Unix Datetime

Each decoder is implemented in a separate script or tool, allowing for easy navigation and integration into your CTF-solving workflow.

## Usage

To use any decoder from this toolkit, simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the specific decoder script you need. Then, follow the instructions provided in the respective README file for that decoder.

Most decoders are designed to be straightforward and easy to use. You can typically input the encoded data directly into the decoder script or provide it as a command-line argument, depending on the implementation.

## Contribution

Contributions to this toolkit are welcome! If you have a decoder that you'd like to add or if you've encountered a bug that needs fixing, feel free to submit a pull request. Additionally, suggestions for new decoders or improvements to existing ones are appreciated.

Please ensure that your contributions align with the goals of the toolkit and maintain consistency with the existing coding style and documentation standards.

## Disclaimer

While this toolkit aims to assist in solving CTF challenges, it's important to remember the ethics of cybersecurity. Only use these decoders for legitimate purposes within the context of CTF competitions or authorized security testing. Any unauthorized or malicious use of these tools is strictly prohibited.
